# Lane Lines Project

### Overview
When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

### How to Use
All of my Python code is in the Jupyter notebook titled 'P1.ipynb'. In the 'test_images' folder, you can see the images that were fed into the code as well as the altered images that the code produced (denoted by 'Output_'). The 'test_videos' folder contains the videos fed into the code, and the 'test_videos_output' folder contains the videos created by the code. The formal writeup is titled 'writeup.md'.
